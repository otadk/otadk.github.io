# Building the Foundation: From Structure to Vision

As I move into the second phase of rebuilding my personal website, my focus has shifted toward **integrating past experiences and planning for the future**.  
This stage is not just about technical reconstruction — it’s also an exercise in **growth, reflection, and continuity**.

## An Unexpected Halt: Lessons from the AWS Outage

At the end of October, our company’s application became unavailable due to an **AWS outage**.  
Those few hours of downtime were my first real encounter with the fragility of “the cloud.”  
Although my boss mentioned creating an emergency plan, the topic quietly faded after a week.  
This experience strengthened my belief that **system resilience and disaster recovery**  
should always remain a core focus in my development work.

## Staying Composed in Volatility: The CS Update and Investment Loss

On October 23rd, a major **CS update** triggered significant market fluctuations,  
causing my investment account to lose over **$10,000 USD** in a single day.  
It was emotionally difficult, but I kept my routine — working, learning, and staying calm.  
A week later, the market rebounded partially, and so did my mindset.

**It wasn’t just a chart of losses — it was a reflection of my emotional volatility.**

## Project Revival and Renewal

During this phase, I successfully migrated an old project —  
the **Snake Game** I built years ago for a competition at Huawei.  
It’s now integrated into the **“Projects”** section of my site,  
marking not just the revival of code, but also a reconnection with my past self.

I also completed the first version of the new **TODO system**,  
powered by Vue and backed by a static `todo.json` file.  
It supports local storage and JSON import/export,  
making task tracking more structured and maintainable.

Additionally, I implemented a **glassmorphism-style navigation bar**,  
giving the top navigation a translucent, layered visual effect that enhances depth and immersion across the site.

## The Dream Page: A Work-in-Progress “Mind Space”

The “Dream” page is still in its early form,  
but I envision it evolving into a **Digital Mood Board** —  
a space where keywords, visuals, and animations drift freely,  
capturing both ideas and emotional states.

Over time, it will grow into the most **human and expressive** part of my website.

## Phase Achievements

- ✅ Built the new **TODO system** (JSON import/export + local storage)  
- ✅ Successfully migrated the old **Snake Game** project (Huawei competition)  
- ✅ Added a **glassmorphism-style navigation bar** for enhanced visual depth

## Goals for the Next Two Weeks

1. **Enhance the homepage and Dream page** with better visuals and motion effects  
2. **Improve the TODO display (Plan section)** for clearer progress tracking  
3. Learn and apply **Fastify** for backend development at work  
4. Build an experimental **DeepSeek API backend service**  
5. Join the **CCF algorithm competition** and resume algorithm training  

> The theme of this phase is **resilience, reflection, and renewal.**  
> Even after technical setbacks and financial turbulence, I want both my **code and dreams to keep growing.**
