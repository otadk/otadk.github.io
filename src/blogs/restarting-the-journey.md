# Restarting the Journey: Notes on Rebuilding My Personal Website
*Phase 1 Blog Notes · Oct 2025*

After three years, I’ve decided to restart my personal website project. Back in 2021, I made an attempt, but for various reasons, I couldn’t keep it up, and eventually, the site disappeared after the domain expired. Now that I’ve settled into a new work environment, I’m determined to begin again — to build a site that truly serves as my **personal portfolio** and a space to accumulate my creative work.


## Weekly Highlights

Here are some snapshots I took this week — just small moments that inspired me and kicked off this week’s journey.

## My Technical Journey

- Spent one year at the **University of Glasgow** as an **international postgraduate student in Software Development**, where I deepened my understanding of software engineering principles, collaborative development, and modern system design  
- Started programming with **C language** as a student, but my first part-time job unexpectedly led me into **PHP** development  
- Focused on the **Java** tech stack for my **Huawei OD** interview, but once onboard, transitioned fully into **frontend development with Vue**  
- After a year and a half at Huawei, I chose to resign without a backup plan, went through a brief low point, and then successfully landed a new job  

During my year in Glasgow, I gained invaluable experience working in multicultural teams, engaging in research-oriented coursework, and experimenting with advanced topics such as software architecture, data visualization, and human-computer interaction. The exposure not only strengthened my technical foundation but also expanded my creative thinking and adaptability as a developer.

At this stage, I have a clear direction in frontend development and a deeper understanding of the value of being a **frontend engineer with creative vision**. The design sense and creativity that I can’t always express at work — I plan to fully explore them through my personal website.

## Blog Update and Development Plan

I’ll follow a **biweekly update schedule**, publishing one blog post every two weeks to document progress and reflections. This rhythm allows for deeper thinking while keeping things sustainable.

### First Biweekly Goals

1. **Basic Architecture Setup**
   - Deploy the site using GitHub Pages  
   - Design and implement a minimalist logo  

2. **Core Feature Development**
   - Build a simple SVG editor for logo creation  
   - Implement a TODO feature (CRUD) with JSON data export  

3. **Visual Design & Optimization**
   - Create a pixel-art style homepage as my first portfolio piece  

Currently, the website only has its basic structure in place. Through continuous iteration, I aim to gradually enhance both its functionality and content.

## Vision for the Website

With this relaunch, I hope to achieve three core goals:

- **Personal Branding** – A focused platform to showcase technical skills and project experience  
- **Creative Playground** – A space to experiment with new ideas and interactions that might not fit into work projects  
- **Growth Chronicle** – A record of technical progress and evolving thought through biweekly reflections
