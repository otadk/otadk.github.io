# Opening the next: Closure, Reflection, and a New Beginning  
*December 2025*

The past two weeks marked a small but meaningful **Ending Phase**.  
During this period, I wasn’t chasing explosive productivity. Instead, I focused on wrapping up tasks I had previously opened—one by one—so I could clear space for the next stage I’m truly excited about: **indie game development**.

Here’s what I completed and consolidated during this cycle.

## 🎯 1. Algorithm Training: A Steady Rhythm

Algorithms remain the most stable routine I’ve kept.  
Compared with before, my practice now feels more natural, less pressured, and yet more rewarding.

During the past two weeks, I:

- Continued consistent problem-solving  
- Participated in virtual contests to maintain rhythm  
- Went further into graph theory, dynamic programming, and search  
- Noticed a real improvement in how quickly solution ideas form  

Algorithms are no longer simply “for competitions.”  
They’ve become a form of **mental endurance training** — the more I run, the steadier I get.

## 🪐 2. Universe Component Published

I redesigned and refined a commonly used work component into a reusable, general-purpose version, then successfully uploaded it to **Universe**.  
I also completed a UI challenge on Universe during the process.

What I focused on:

- Designing for general use cases rather than business-specific scenarios  

The component itself isn’t complex, but this was my first time **publicly releasing and productizing** one of my frontend modules.  
Its value lies not in the code, but in the act of publishing it.

## 💰 3. Personal Finance System: From Notes to a Real Application

I started by keeping financial records in a simple document—crude but consistent.  
The more I recorded, the clearer it became:

> “Logging numbers is just input; the real value is in analysis and reflection.”

So I built a lightweight but practical **personal finance system**, including:

- Cash flow  
- Custom categories  
- A basic investment portfolio structure  
- Data visualization (trend charts, monthly charts, etc.)  

The frontend, data model, and charts are all functioning.  
It’s not a full product yet, but it already helps me understand my financial landscape far better.  
This is a milestone I’m genuinely proud of.

## 🧭 4. Natural Closure of Tasks (Ending Phase)

With these tasks wrapped up, I clearly felt that:

> A certain chapter has now come to an end.

During this phase, I improved and explored across many areas—my website, automation, AI, Fastify, Universe components, tools, and algorithms.  
I moved from “fragmented improvements” to a more complete technical foundation.

And now—  
I want to shift my focus to something **more long-term, more creative, and far more exciting**:

# 🎮 The Next Chapter: Indie Game Development

Starting in December, I’ll begin a new thematic cycle:  
**Building my own indie game.**

And I can genuinely feel that I’m ready:

- Algorithms: stronger foundations in logic and math  
- Frontend: confident with design, UI, and interactions  
- Backend: smooth workflows with Fastify and Node  
- AI: can help generate story, dialogue, and content  
- Automation & tooling: boosts development efficiency  
- Aesthetics: homepage redesign & Universe work sharpened my visual sense  

None of these skills were studied specifically for game development,  
but all of them will help me move faster and more confidently as I build a game.

That’s why I believe—  
**this is the perfect moment to start the next chapter.**

## ✨ Summary

These two weeks weren’t an intense sprint.  
They felt more like a light and intentional *ending ritual*:

Organizing  
Finishing  
Publishing  
Reflecting  
Closing  

I gathered all the open threads and tied them together into a complete chapter.

Starting next issue—  
the main theme will shift to **indie game development**, marking the beginning of a new story.

**This is an Ending, but also an Opening.**

I will no longer continue updating here.
