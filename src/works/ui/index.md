title: UI Showcase
---

A handful of small, self-contained UI experiments with live playgrounds you can tweak.

- **Guided tour overlay** — [DIY Tour Demo](/works/ui/diy-tour-demo): highlight any element, mask the page, and walk users through steps.
- **CTA with promo tag** — [Button Discount](/works/ui/button-discount): a gradient button topped with a floating “discount” label.
- **Playful rainbow CTA** — [Button Mastery 12](/works/ui/button-mastery-12): animated hover effects, gradient icon tile, and confetti pieces.
